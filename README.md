Source Code for www.rug-b.de
============================

This is the collaborative effort of the RubyUserGroup::Berlin (RUG-B) to create a new public site featuring the group's various activities.

Design Goals / Decisions
------------------------

We are using StaticMatic to generate the actual site to be pushed to [Github Pages](http://rug-b.github.com).

All content will be pulled live from various RSS feeds. Some of these feeds will be provided using Yahoo! pipes applying custom filters and post-processing. Should this turn out to be too limited, we will create our own aggregator/identiy mapper/feed emitter.
